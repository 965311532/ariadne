This would involve the Artist Strategy and other channels (custom consumer embroideries). After discussing this with Luca, we realized maybe this is not the best option.\n\nWe need to optimize for:\n\n- Lower costs (so that we have more options available to us after launching)\n- Rapidness of launch (launching faster keeps us more driven and maximizes success rate, since the main start-up obstacle is really to get it from 'we are working on a thing' to 'we are running a revenue-generating company')\n- Lower complexity (so that we are more free to change things up as we experiment and get feedback)\n\nConsidering our current implementation (to develop the B2C with artists, custom-made and B2B channels) it's clear that we need to make some changes or we are far off from what we need to optimize in order to get what we want (which is a sustainable business model that can generate profits).\n\nThis does not mean that we need to 'rethink' everything. It just means rearranging things in a way that is more suitable for our situation. In particular, we think that:\n\n- Since the custom made channel is most likely going to be a low-margin channel (few pieces at a time, no scalability, high labor), it should come later.\n- The Artist channel is very complex. We need to set up a proper ecommerce, think about the design guidelines, communicate with the artists, getting the designs, ordering the right apparel for everyone, testing the collection out, sending samples to the artists, etc. This is a lot of work and it may drag things out. We suggest to leave the development of this channel for later.\n\nThis leaves out the B2B channel. More on this later.\n\nAt this stage, every euro matters, because we still need to show that this is a business model that can generate profits. Until we get there, we need to prioritize high R.O.I., fast converting investments. Some of what we are planning is very R.O.I., but on a longer timeframe. This includes the investment in the design and branding of the website and the company. Clearly we all agree that it's something we want to do very well, but it might make sense to delay it until we know we have a working strategy to improve. Just to be clear, the changes would be:\n\n- We freeze all agreements with Mattia, Myles and Simona, who we would call again to develop the original plan when and if it comes back in the active scope of the project\n- We develop an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) website and fulfilling strategy (order and payment processing, shipping, etc.) as fast as possible\n- We start developing only the B2B channel, optimizing the B2B orientation and processes\n\nWhy B2B?\n\nIt's more scalable, has higher margins (we sell for less but without the artists commissions), larger orders (which are easier to manage), and the development complexity and cost is very low (all we need is a static website and a payment processor). We also have prospect clients and are more easily in contact with high value prospects (especially Luca).\n\nThe B2B channel is easier to start, has lower costs and more reward opportunities in the short term. It's clearly the best option.\n\n(This doesn't mean that we can't to one-offs or artist work, but they won't be our goals and we won't put lots of money or effort into them until later in time)\n\nWe understand that part of the reason why you wanted to started the project was to have it also serve a sort of creative outlet, but I feel that this is the best strategy if we want to try to improve the probabilities that that outlet is sustainable. Once it is, we can expand and try things out (there's also an interesting idea from Mattia if we want to talk about how to develop the Artist Strategy in parallel through SCSC or 77, but detached from TESEO).\n\nLet us know what you think.\n---\n\nUpon review of the above email, please reply according with your guidelines.

Our core product is going to be the embroidery service, meant as the activity of actually making the custom embroidery for the clients.\n\nLet's try to determine (I'll have to make a few assumptions) the costs for a typical t-shirt or hoodie. I'm picking these two items because I feel these are probably going to be the biggest percentage of items sold in terms of type.\nSince we don't really need to worry about rent and labor, we gain a lot of economic freedom in how we want to structure our economic offer. We can either choose to keep prices higher, and therefore accelerate our way to breakeven (because we are going to make more profits), or we can lower the prices to try to be more attractive to customers. We need to keep in mind that these privileges are going to expire sooner or later, so we should remember that these are the real costs. If we choose to not charge any markup (selling at cost), it will lead to us eventually have to raise prices in order to keep being profitable, as rent and other costs that we don't have now will start eating into our profits.\n\nAssuming zero expenses in rent and labor, and approximating the prices of t-shirts to be €16-€45 (plus shipping) for t-shirts and €40-€81 for hoodies, this is how price and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) shapes up based on markup level. What the table above [removed for brevity] says is that in order to go breakeven (make €20k in revenue), we need to sell €30k worth of t-shirts (which is ~500-2000 units, based on what price we sell them at) or ~€40k worth of hoodies (350-1000 units) or a combination of the two. If we give ourselves a target of two years to go breakeven, that would mean selling about 60 units a month for 24 months.\n\nI think this is an ambitious but reasonable target.\n\nLet me know what you guys think,\n\nGabriele\n---\n\nUpon review of the above email, please reply according with your guidelines.

I encourage you to write emails often as I feel it has a positive effect both as a way to write structured reflections, and from now on also to provide Ariadne with more content that she can use to help us out.\n\nI think that a good way to start things off would be to describe exactly what TESEO is and what we are trying to achieve. I'll do the introductions:\n\n- Gabriele (Me): co-founder, I develop software, Italy, Genoa, 23\n- Luca: co-founder and famous Italian content creator (social media), Italy, Milan/Genoa, 24\n- Milo: co-founder, had the original idea, studies hospitality at EHL Hospitality Business School, Swiss, Lausanne/Geneva, 22\n- Myles: involved in the development of the tech side of the company, works as a software engineer, USA, Seattle, 21\n- Mattia: involved in the commercial and artistic side of the project, studies Art and \"Art making with new technologies\", Italy, Brescia/Genoa, 21\nTESEO is a project that we are starting to develop. We want to create a company to offer custom embroidery services to businesses (and maybe consumers). We want to make good quality products and to develop interesting business and friendly relationships with partners and clients. As you may have understood, the idea behind the name of the company is from the myth of Theseus. We like the imagery and the story.\n\nSay hi to everyone and feel free to ask questions if you have them.\n\nGabriele\n---\n\nUpon review of the above email, please reply according with your guidelines.

I'm thrilled to be part of the TESEO team and assist in developing our custom embroidery services.\n\nFrom the previous correspondence, I understand that the original idea was to launch both the B2B and B2C channels. I reflected on the discussion about prioritizing the B2B channel due to its lower costs and higher reward opportunities in the short term. This is a strategic move, especially for startups, as it allows for **quicker revenue generation and scalability**. \n\nI think we should define clearly if this is just a launching strategy with the possibility to develop the B2C channel later or we want to go forward with the B2B as our core business channel.\n\nIn terms of economic outlook, reaching breakeven in two years by selling about 60 units a month for 24 months is indeed ambitious, but with the right strategies and execution, it's achievable.\n\n**We should conduct a thorough market analysis to understand our potential customers better**, unless you have done that already. If you did please let me know so I can take that into account in the following discussions.\n\nAdditionally, we need to develop a robust marketing strategy to increase our brand visibility and reach out to potential B2B clients. If he is available in this regard and the product/service fits his vibe, we could leverage Luca's social media influence to boost the visibility of the company.\n\nLastly, I agree with the idea of developing an MVP website and fulfilling strategy as soon as possible. This will enable us to collect valuable customer feedback that we can use to choose the best course of action and quickly iterate on our strategy.\n\nI'm looking forward to working with all of you and contributing to TESEO's success.\n\nBest,\nAriadne"
